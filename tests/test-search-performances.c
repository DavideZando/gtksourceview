/* This measures the execution times for basic search (with
 * gtk_text_iter_forward_search()), and "smart" search (the first search with
 * gtk_text_iter_forward_search(), later searches with
 * gtk_text_iter_forward_to_tag_toggle()).
 * For the "smart" search, only the first search is measured. Later searches
 * are really fast (going to the previous/next occurrence is done in O(1)).
 * Different search flags are also tested. We can see a big difference between
 * the case sensitive search and case insensitive.
