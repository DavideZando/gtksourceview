TODO:

Syntax/Pattern Tables --> Tags
---------------------

* make syntax/pattern inherited from GtkTextTag instead of creating my own Tables.

GtkSourceView 
----------

Create an GtkSourceView inherited from GtkTextView

* show line numbers at the left side of widget
* implement possibilities to set/clear line marks (for breakpoints etc..)  
* show column/line/offset at bottom something like ("line %d column %d charoffset %d")

GtkSourceBuffer
-----------

* fix loop bug in check_brackets

* insert callback, needs more testing... 

* delete callback

need to work on this */

1. first check if startiter holds a tag, if true then iterate backward until tag change */
2. iterate enditer forward until tag change 
3. remove tags and update from new start and end iters  
4. if no tags well iterate from line_start to iterend's line end 
    also check if syntax tag if true then ignore and let widgert take care 


Bugs:

1. syntax Highlighting needs more testing.
.----------------------------.

* when instering text in a syntax region it must check whats inserted
  to make sure higlighting correctly right now its a bit broken.

* widget sometimes hangs when scrolling i think this has to do with the check_brackets
  implementation...

Implement:
-----------

* show breakpoints in SourceView
* Add breakpoints to textbuffer or create
 an class called GtkBreakpointTable(Gobject'ed) and add
  gtk_text_view_set_breakpoint_table(...)? hmm need to think about this.

maybe a new class is best because then we could add  g_siganls to it:

"remove/change/insert"  (when removing line the breakpoint should also kill?)
